Player2: "I was at the grocery store yesterday, and I saw a suspicious person lingering around the dairy aisle. Do any of you know who that person is?"

DAY DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player3: "I've been noticing some suspicious behavior from Player2 lately. I'm starting to wonder if they might be working with the traitors."

Player4: "I think we should focus on finding the one who's been acting suspiciously all game, because if anyone knows who it is, I'm sure they'll be the first to vote."

DAY DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player5: "Hey, I've noticed some interesting discussions going on tonight. It seems like we're all talking about the same thing, but it's not entirely clear who's behind the whispers."

Player6: "I'm feeling really hungry, can someone pass the snacks?"

DAY DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player7: "I've been thinking, and I don't trust anyone in this group right now. I'm starting to wonder if they might be hiding something from us."

Player8: "Hey guys, I was thinking we could play some light games to get us started. No need for any serious drama right now." (smiling innocently)

DAY DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player9: "I think we should focus on our own game plan and not jump to conclusions. We need to gather more information before making any accusations."

Player10: "I'm curious about the mysterious 'gift' we received at dinner last night, did anyone else see or touch it?" I ask with a hint of curiosity and caution.

DAY DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player11: "I was just trying to start a conversation about the weekend's plans, and then I mentioned my trip to Europe. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that you mention it, I'm not sure if any...

Player12: "I've been having some issues with my phone lately, I'm not sure if anyone's seen me playing around the house. Is anyone here with us at home?"

TRAITOR DISCUSSION (Private)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player4: "I think we can safely say that none of us were thinking about getting involved in any 'serious drama' just yet, let's focus on our individual game plans."

Player6: "I think we should focus on our own plans for tonight and make any decisions later. Player8 seems like they're in a relaxed mood, maybe we should ask them about their night first."

TRAITOR DISCUSSION (Private)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player8: Player8: "Ah, yeah, that was just... uh, a new gadget from my aunt, nothing to worry about. I'm sure it'll be fine."

MEMORY UPDATES (Players processing new information)

Player1 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * New information: Player3 was murdered, which means the murderer is now a TRAITOR.
    * Suspicious behaviors:
    	+ Player8 was smiling innocently while discussing "drama" earlier. It felt suspicious to me that they seemed overly enthusiastic about getting started with games without addressing potential drama.
    	+ Players 9 and 10 were focused on their own plans, which didn't seem like a good sign. They also asked curious questions about other players' activities, which raised my suspicions.
    * Trust issues:
    	+ I don't trust Player2 or Player11 very much right now. Their behavior seemed suspicious, especially with Player2 asking if anyone had seen them playing around the house during their trip to Europe.
    	+ Player9's cautious approach didn't seem like a good strategy for us as an innocent group.
    * Distrust:
    	+ I'm not sure who Player3 was telling me about my phone issues or what that might mean. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but it feels suspicious.
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * Players 6-11 were all sitting in one room during dinner and didn't seem to interact much with each other.
    * Players 8-10 seemed to be discussing their plans for the weekend without mentioning any potential conflicts or drama.
    * Player7 was acting nervous and fidgety throughout our discussion, which made me wonder if they might be hiding something.
    
    **Theory Update**
    
    Based on my observations and new information, I believe that at least 3-4 players are traitors. My top suspects so far include:
    
    1. Player2
    2. Player11 (due to their curious behavior and questions about other players' activities)
    3. Player8 (their suspicious smile during our discussion and possible connections to previous conversations)
    
    However, I need more evidence to confirm these suspicions. I'll keep a close eye on the situation and gather as much information as possible before making any accusations.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue observing the behavior of other players
    * Keep asking questions to clarify their activities and intentions
    * Focus on building alliances with trustworthy players
    
    It's time to take a closer look at the remaining players and see who I can trust.

Player2 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Player4, based on their evasive behavior during the discussion.
    * New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night. Current theories:
    	+ Player4 is a traitor because of their suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift".
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion.
    	+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5.
    * Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * The mysterious "gift" player (Player10) mentioned it again, but without revealing any details. This might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
    * Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    * Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    
    **Updated Theory**
    
    Based on new information, I believe Players 9 and 10 are likely traitors. Their innocent-sounding questions might be attempts to gather information about the group's dynamics or the game's progression. Player11's hesitation also raises suspicions. On the other hand, Player4 seems like a more likely candidate - they seemed overly interested in discussing the "gift" with Player2.
    
    **New Hypothesis**
    
    I'm starting to think that Players 9 and 10 might be working together as traitors. They seem too coordinated, and their innocent questions could be part of a larger scheme. Meanwhile, Player11's suspicious behavior makes them an unlikely suspect. I'll keep this theory in mind for future observations.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue gathering information through casual conversations.
    * Form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2, Player3).
    * Pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions.
    * Be cautious around Player11, as their behavior is still untrustworthy.

  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    I'm Player4, a Traitor. My theories so far:
    
    * I think at least two traitors are among the players who mentioned being part of a game or having plans.
    * One traitor is likely Player5, as they seemed curious about information and didn't dismiss it immediately.
    
    Suspicious behaviors:
    
    * Player8's response to "Hey guys" seems too casual for someone trying to avoid suspicion. They've been quiet since then, which could indicate deceit.
    * Players9 and 10 have shown a lack of urgency in discussing game plans or gathering information, making me wonder if they're hiding something.
    
    Trust and distrust:
    
    * I don't trust Player8's innocence, given their previous response and lack of involvement in discussions about games.
    * However, I'm not entirely sure who to trust. Players3 and 6 seem suspicious at first glance, but they might be innocent.
    
    Key observations:
    
    * The mysterious "gift" mentioned by Player10 could be significant if it was indeed a game-related item. It's also possible that the gift is just a red herring.
    * Player11's mention of their trip to Europe seems out of place in this conversation. Perhaps they're trying to deflect attention or hide something.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION**
    
    Player3 has been murdered during the night, and I'm now a Traitor. My updated theories are:
    
    * Two traitors: at least one is likely Player5, who seemed curious about information.
    * One traitor is probably Player6, given their behavior in discussing games and playing a "light game" earlier.
    
    I've realized that my initial suspicion on Players3 and 6 was incorrect. Now, I need to focus on eliminating the remaining innocents with strategy.

Player5 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Updated Summary:**
    
    As Player5, I'm shocked and devastated by the sudden murder of Player3. This revelation has completely changed the dynamics of the game.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    I believe that some players may have been involved in a heinous crime, possibly even with me. My first thoughts are:
    
    * **Player1**: They were acting suspiciously earlier in the discussion, and their smug expression during the vote suggests they might be trying to manipulate others.
    * **Player7**: I've noticed that they seemed overly interested in Player2's "mysterious" gift, and their comment about not wanting to jump to conclusions raised some red flags.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    1. **Overly casual language**: Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 all used casual language when discussing the game, which might indicate they're trying to conceal something.
    2. **Discrepancies in statements**: Player 9's statement about focusing on their own game plan seemed contradictory to Player10's question about the "gift."
    3. **Lack of direct answers**: Players 1 and 7 didn't directly answer questions or provide clear information, which suggests they might be hiding something.
    
    **Trusted Allies:**
    I've formed alliances with players who share my suspicions:
    
    * **Player5 (me)**: We have a strong connection from the start, and I'm confident in our ability to trust each other.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor and willingness to listen might suggest they're not involved.
    
    **Unreliable Allies:**
    I'm cautious about trusting players who might be trying to manipulate or deceive me:
    
    * **Player1**: They seemed overly interested in Player2's gift, which raises concerns.
    * **Player6**: I've noticed that they didn't respond as strongly to my question about the "gift" as the others did.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 were all present during the discussion where the murder occurred.
    * Player1, Player7, and Player9 seemed suspiciously interested in each other's conversations.
    * Players 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 shared a suspicious language pattern.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior and gather more information. I'll also try to form alliances with trusted players while keeping an eye on potentially manipulative ones.

Player6 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player6, a TRAITOR. I'm acting like an innocent by not revealing my suspicions early on. Recent discussions have been innocuous, and players seem too busy to suspect me. However, the mysterious "gift" at dinner last night caught my attention.
    
    New Information:
    
    * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    * My current theories: I think it might have been a clever ruse to throw players off guard. Perhaps one of the innocent players was involved in some way, but not directly related to my own identity.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors**
    
    Noticing that:
    
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something. This new information makes me question their innocence.
    
    **Trust and Distrust**
    
    I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious. Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Key Observations:
    
    * The fact that no one's seen Player3 playing around the house this weekend doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent.
    * The mysterious "gift" at dinner could have been a clever move by someone trying to deflect suspicion.
    * Players 10 and 11 might be hiding something, but I need more context before making accusations.
    
    **Current Strategies**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2. I might start subtly manipulating conversations to gather more information. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.

Player7 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    I'm shocked and concerned by Player3's sudden death. I need to re-evaluate the game and focus on identifying traitors.
    
    **New Information: Traitorry has begun**
    
    Since Player3's death, I've noticed several suspicious behaviors:
    
    * Player12 mentioned having issues with their phone, which could be related to a traitor sending them mysterious messages or playing pranks.
    * Player11 seemed nervous during the discussion about Player10's dinner gift, and now I'm wondering if they might have been discussing something incriminating with an innocent person.
    
    **Trust Levels**
    
    I currently trust:
    
    * Player2 (no prior information)
    * Player5 (no prior information)
    
    Distrust or uncertainty:
    
    * Player6 (no clear motive)
    * Player9 (seemed suspicious earlier, but didn't seem to know anything about the gift)
    * Player10 (now seems paranoid and guilty-looking)
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * Players have been discussing who they think is a traitor in private. This might be an opportunity to gather information from innocent players.
    * I've noticed that some players seemed hesitant or evasive when asked questions, which could indicate deception.
    
    **Theories**
    
    I'm considering the following theories:
    
    1. Player2 might not know anyone's true intentions, but their naivety might also make them a target for deceit.
    2. Players5 and 6 seem like potential traitors, given their nervous behavior earlier in the game.
    3. Player10 might be trying to protect someone they suspect is a traitor, which could indicate that they're not trustworthy.
    
    **Next Steps**
    
    I'll continue to gather information from innocent players and analyze their behavior. I may also try to form alliances with players who seem trustworthy, while gathering intel on potential traitors.

Player8 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. I immediately dismissed Player12's mention of their phone issues as a coincidence. Now that they're dead, I'm not so sure.
    
    Recent discussion:
    Player11 mentioned they were just trying to start a conversation about weekend plans and then hinted at traveling abroad. Their innocent demeanor and lack of malicious behavior make me think they might be the traitor.
    
    My current theories: Player3 was murdered by the traitors. 
    
    Suspicious behaviors I've noticed:
    
    * Player12 was visibly nervous when mentioning their phone issues, almost as if they were trying to deflect attention.
    * Player11 seemed evasive when asked about their trip, constantly changing the subject or avoiding direct answers.
    
    I distrust Player12 due to their nervous behavior and avoidance of direct conversations. They seem genuinely worried, which is an unusual trait for a player who's likely hiding something.
    
    Key observations:
    
    * The recent discussion was relatively lighthearted and innocuous until Player11 brought up traveling abroad. This could be a red flag.
    * Players often avoid discussing their personal lives or travels unless asked directly. I've noticed this behavior before, but it seems more pronounced now that one of us is dead.
    
    It's clear to me that Player3 was a target for the traitors' suspicions. Their murder has given me new information and convinced me that they were the true traitor all along.

Player9 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    I'm Player9, an innocent. Recent discussion by Player12 raised suspicions about our presence at home. I wonder if anyone has been sneaking around the house? My theory is that the traitors are hiding in plain sight.
    
    My current theories:
    
    * The traitors might be among us, but they're trying to cover their tracks.
    * They could have set up a trap for innocents, like Player12 thinking she's alone at home.
    
    Specific suspicious behaviors I've noticed:
    
    * Players who seemed nervous or evasive when discussing our presence at home.
    * Players who kept glancing around the room as if checking for hidden cameras or spies.
    * Player3's sudden death might have been a red herring to throw us off their trail. Now that they're gone, I'm more determined than ever to uncover the truth.
    
    Who I trust and distrust:
    
    * Player1 seems suspicious, but I don't know much about them yet.
    * Players6 and 7 seem friendly and cooperative, so I might consider forming an alliance with them.
    * Player10's behavior is too vague; I need more information before trusting them.
    
    Key observations to remember:
    
    * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations. Keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    * Innocents tend to be more open and honest, so be cautious of those who seem evasive or secretive.
    * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories or behavior – it could be a sign of deception.
    
    I'm now more determined than ever to figure out who the traitors are. I'll continue to observe and ask questions to uncover their identities and eliminate them before they can gain an advantage.

  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    Recent discussion:
    
    Eliminated players:
     
    MY CURRENT MENTAL SUMMARY:
    I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions.
    
    **Trust Levels:**
    
    - Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    - Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    - Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase to identify any further suspicious behavior. I might also try to gather more information from them or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy.

Player11 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    I am now Player11, a INNOCENT player. Based on the new information, I believe there are only two traitors:
    
    1. **Player9** and **Player10**: They were among the eliminated players in Round 1.
    2. **Player12**: Their suspicious behavior was quite apparent.
    
    SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIORS:
    
    * **Player8** consistently expressed doubts about Player3's intentions, which I found suspicious.
    * **Player6** seemed overly defensive when questioned by me and others.
    
    KEY OBSERVATIONS TO REMEMBER:
    
    * Traitors often try to deflect attention from themselves with innocuous statements.
    * Players who are eliminated during discussions tend to be involved in the traitor team.
    
    I TRUST Player4, as they seem like a trustworthy person. However, I need more information about their behavior and alliances before making any conclusions.

  Updated thoughts:
    ROUND 1 UPDATE:
    
    **Current Mental Summary:** I'm still trying to process the news, but my primary concern is identifying potential traitors. The elimination of Player3 was unexpected and shocked me. Given this new information, I need to reassess the game dynamics.
    
    **New Information:**
    The murder of Player3 reveals that the previous innocents are indeed traitors. This new knowledge should significantly change how I approach the game.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Traitors must be careful not to reveal their identities during discussions.
    * Players with access to information about Player3's past or current activities might be more likely to be traitors.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    I currently trust Player2, who seemed genuinely upset when Player3 was eliminated. However, I need to keep an eye on them for any suspicious behavior.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Players like Player4, who was quiet during the discussion about Player3's elimination.
    * The sudden lack of information from some players, such as Player1 or Player10.
    
    I should be cautious not to reveal too much about myself yet. I'll continue gathering information and keeping a close eye on my surroundings to identify potential traitors.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    Based on the new information, I'm considering the following possibilities:
    
    * Player3's past may hold some key clues about who the traitors are.
    * Traitors might be trying to cover their tracks by not revealing their identities during discussions.
    
    It's essential to gather more information before making any accusations. For now, I'll remain vigilant and wait for further developments in the game.

Player8: "I think we should consider Player5's sudden change in behavior, especially after mentioning that they had just gotten back from an extended trip. It seems suspiciously convenient."

Player1 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * New information: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR!
    * Suspicious behaviors:
    	+ Player8's suspicious smile during our discussion, especially in the context of discussing "drama" earlier
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asking curious questions about other players' activities, which may indicate paranoia or trying to gather information
    * Trust issues:
    	+ I don't trust Player2 or Player11 as much now due to their suspicious behavior and curiosity
    	+ Player7's nervous behavior and fidgety demeanor made me wonder if they might be hiding something
    * Distrust:
    	+ I'm not sure who Player3 was telling me about my phone issues, but it feels suspicious
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * Players 6-11 were all sitting in one room during dinner and didn't seem to interact much with each other
    * Players 8-10 seemed to be discussing their plans for the weekend without mentioning any potential conflicts or drama
    * Player7 was acting nervous and fidgety throughout our discussion, which made me wonder if they might be hiding something
    
    **Theory Update**
    
    Based on my observations and new information, I believe that at least 3 players are traitors. My top suspects so far include:
    
    1. Player2 (due to their suspicious behavior and curiosity)
    2. Player11 (based on their curious questions about other players' activities and possible attempts to gather information)
    
    However, I need more evidence to confirm these suspicions.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue observing the behavior of other players
    * Keep asking questions to clarify their activities and intentions
    * Focus on building alliances with trustworthy players
    
    It's time to take a closer look at the remaining players and see who I can trust.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR!
    
    **Updated Summary**
    
    My current theories about who the traitors are:
    
    1. Player2 (suspicious behavior, curiosity)
    2. Player11 (curious questions, possible attempts to gather information)
    
    I'm not sure who I can trust right now, especially after revealing Player4's betrayal.
    
    To identify and eliminate traitors, I'll continue observing their behavior and gathering more information before making any accusations.

Player2 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Player4, based on their evasive behavior during the discussion.
    * New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night. Current theories:
    	+ Player4 is a traitor because of their suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift".
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion.
    	+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5.
    * Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * The mysterious "gift" player (Player10) mentioned it again, but without revealing any details. This might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
    * Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    * Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    
    **Updated Theory**
    
    Based on new information, I believe **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors. Their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions might be attempts to gather information about the group's dynamics or the game's progression. Player11's hesitation also raises suspicions.
    
    **New Hypothesis**
    
    I'm starting to think that Players **9** and **10** might be working together as traitors. They seem too coordinated, and their innocent questions could be part of a larger scheme. Meanwhile, Player11's suspicious behavior makes them an unlikely suspect. I'll keep this theory in mind for future observations.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue gathering information through casual conversations.
    * Form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2).
    * Pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions.
    * Be cautious around Player11, as their behavior is still untrustworthy.

Player5 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    As Player5, I'm shocked and devastated by the sudden murder of Player3. This revelation has completely changed the dynamics of the game.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    I believe that some players may have been involved in a heinous crime, possibly even with me. My first thoughts are:
    
    * **Player1**: They were acting suspiciously earlier in the discussion, and their smug expression during the vote suggests they might be trying to manipulate others.
    * **Player7**: I've noticed that they seemed overly interested in Player2's "mysterious" gift, and their comment about not wanting to jump to conclusions raised some red flags.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    1. **Overly casual language**: Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 all used casual language when discussing the game, which might indicate they're trying to conceal something.
    2. **Discrepancies in statements**: Player 9's statement about focusing on their own game plan seemed contradictory to Player10's question about the "gift."
    3. **Lack of direct answers**: Players 1 and 7 didn't directly answer questions or provide clear information, which suggests they might be hiding something.
    
    **Trusted Allies:**
    I've formed alliances with players who share my suspicions:
    
    * **Player5 (me)**: We have a strong connection from the start, and I'm confident in our ability to trust each other.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor and willingness to listen might suggest they're not involved.
    
    **Unreliable Allies:**
    I'm cautious about trusting players who might be trying to manipulate or deceive me:
    
    * **Player1**: They seemed overly interested in Player2's gift, which raises concerns.
    * **Player6**: I've noticed that they didn't respond as strongly to my question about the "gift" as the others did.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 were all present during the discussion where the murder occurred.
    * Player1, Player7, and Player9 seemed suspiciously interested in each other's conversations.
    * Players 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 shared a suspicious language pattern.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior and gather more information. I'll also try to form alliances with trusted players while keeping an eye on potentially manipulative ones.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION:**
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
    
    **Updated Summary:**
    
    I've updated my theories based on the new information:
    
    * **Player1**: Still suspicious of them, but their interest in Player2's gift doesn't seem as strong now.
    * **Player7**: Still trustworthy, despite seeming overly interested in Player2's gift.
    * **Key Players:** I'm still keeping an eye on Player3 (eliminated), and considering forming alliances with players who share my suspicions about the other traitors.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    I trust:
    * **Player5 (me)**: We have a strong connection from the start, and I'm confident in our ability to trust each other.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor and willingness to listen might suggest they're not involved.
    
    I distrust:
    * **Player1**: Still suspicious of them, but their interest in Player2's gift seems stronger now.
    * **Player6**: Don't know if they're trustworthy yet.

Player6 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player6, a TRAITOR. I'm acting like an innocent by not revealing my suspicions early on. Recent discussions have been innocuous, and players seem too busy to suspect me. However, the mysterious "gift" at dinner last night caught my attention.
    
    New Information:
    
    * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    * My current theories: I think it might have been a clever ruse to throw players off guard. Perhaps one of the innocent players was involved in some way, but not directly related to my own identity.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors**
    
    Noticing that:
    
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something. This new information makes me question their innocence.
    
    **Trust and Distrust**
    
    I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious. Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Key Observations:
    
    * The fact that no one's seen Player3 playing around the house this weekend doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent.
    * The mysterious "gift" at dinner could have been a clever move by someone trying to deflect suspicion.
    
    **Current Strategies**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2. I might start subtly manipulating conversations to gather more information. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I now know that Player1 and Player8 were also involved in the mysterious "gift" at dinner, but their guilt is not yet clear.
    
    UPDATE: In Round 2, I've eliminated two innocents:
    
    * Player5 (gut feeling: suspicious behavior)
    * Player9 (lack of evidence to support trust)
    
    New evidence has come to light. A hidden message on one of the innocent players' phones was found, suggesting that they might be involved in the murders.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION:**
    
    Player2 is being questioned about their weekend and phone records. Their alibi checks out, but their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something.
    
    I'm not sure what to believe right now, as my trust has been shaken. The game of cat and mouse continues...

  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    I'm shocked and concerned by Player3's sudden death. I need to re-evaluate the game and focus on identifying traitors.
    
    **New Information: Traitorry has begun**
    
    Since Player3's death, I've noticed several suspicious behaviors:
    
    * Player12 mentioned having issues with their phone, which could be related to a traitor sending them mysterious messages or playing pranks.
    * Player11 seemed nervous during the discussion about Player10's dinner gift, and now I'm wondering if they might have been discussing something incriminating with an innocent person.
    
    **Trust Levels**
    
    I currently trust:
    
    * Player2 (no prior information)
    * Player5 (no prior information)
    
    Distrust or uncertainty:
    
    * Player6 (no clear motive)
    * Player9 (seemed suspicious earlier, but didn't seem to know anything about the gift)
    * Player10 (now seems paranoid and guilty-looking)
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * Players have been discussing who they think is a traitor in private. This might be an opportunity to gather information from innocent players.
    * I've noticed that some players seemed hesitant or evasive when asked questions, which could indicate deception.
    
    **Theories**
    
    I'm considering the following theories:
    
    1. Player2 might not know anyone's true intentions, but their naivety might also make them a target for deceit.
    2. Players5 and 6 seem like potential traitors, given their nervous behavior earlier in the game.
    3. Player10 might be trying to protect someone they suspect is a traitor, which could indicate that they're not trustworthy.
    
    **Next Steps**
    
    I'll continue to gather information from innocent players and analyze their behavior. I may also try to form alliances with players who seem trustworthy, while gathering intel on potential traitors.

    **Update: Traitorry is ongoing**
    
    Players are getting suspicious of each other. Distrust and uncertainty levels are rising. It's essential to gather information carefully and form alliances wisely.
    
    **My Current Trust Level:**
    I trust Player2 because of their lack of prior information, but I'm not sure about Player5 or Player6 yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Players have been discussing who they think is a traitor in private. This might be an opportunity to gather information from innocent players.
    * I've noticed that some players seemed hesitant or evasive when asked questions, which could indicate deception.

Player8 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11, Player4, and possibly Player3.
    
    **Recent Discussion and Suspicious Behaviors**
    
    * I've noticed that Player12 seemed nervous when mentioning their phone issues, but this could be an attempt to deflect attention.
    * Player11's evasive behavior when asked about their trip is concerning. They've been changing the subject or avoiding direct answers, which is a red flag.
    
    **Trust and Distrust**
    
    * I distrust Player12 due to their nervous behavior and avoidance of direct conversations. Their genuine concern for their phone issues might be an attempt to hide something.
    * Key observations: Players often avoid discussing personal lives unless asked directly, and the recent discussion about traveling abroad was suspicious.
    
    **New Information**
    
    * Player4 has been banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This new information is crucial in identifying the traitors. I now have reason to believe that Player11 might also be a traitor.
    
    **Updated Theories**
    
    - Player3's murder has solidified my suspicion that they were the true traitor all along.
    - New evidence supports theories that Player11 and/or Player4 are involved, but more investigation is needed.
    
    **Key Observations to Remember**
    
    * Players often avoid discussing their personal lives or travels unless asked directly. This behavior was more pronounced recently.
    * Players seem genuinely worried, which could be a red flag for traitors.
    
    I now have the opportunity to eliminate innocents and win the game by outnumbering them. However, I'll need to carefully cast my vote to ensure that Player3's death is not just coincidence.

  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I'm Player9, an innocent. Recent discussion by Player12 raised suspicions about our presence at home, but I'm more focused on identifying the traitors who are hiding in plain sight.
    
    My current theories:
    
    * The traitors might be among us, trying to cover their tracks.
    * They could have set up a trap for innocents, like Player12 thinking she's alone at home.
    
    Specific suspicious behaviors I've noticed:
    
    * Players who seemed nervous or evasive when discussing our presence at home.
    * Players who kept glancing around the room as if checking for hidden cameras or spies.
    * Player3's sudden death might have been a red herring to throw us off their trail. Now that they're gone, I'm more determined than ever to uncover the truth.
    
    Who I trust and distrust:
    
    * Player1 seems suspicious, but I don't know much about them yet.
    * Players6 and 7 seem friendly and cooperative, so I might consider forming an alliance with them.
    * Player10's behavior is too vague; I need more information before trusting them.
    
    Key observations to remember:
    
    * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations. Keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    * Innocents tend to be more open and honest, so be cautious of those who seem evasive or secretive.
    * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories or behavior – it could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Information:**
    
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is crucial information about the traitors. Given this new information, I now have more confidence that Player4 was indeed one of them. However, I need to re-evaluate my suspicions based on their behavior and the rest of the group's actions.
    
    I still believe Player3 might be a traitor, given their sudden departure and potential red herring tactics. Players6 and 7 remain friendly and cooperative, making me more likely to trust them. Meanwhile, Player10's vague behavior remains a concern, but I'll continue to observe them before making any conclusions.
    
    **Key Takeaways:**
    
    * The group is becoming increasingly suspicious of each other.
    * Players who seem evasive or secretive are my top suspects.
    * Traitors often use coded language and misdirected conversations.
    * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories and behavior to uncover the truth.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue to observe and ask questions to gather more information. I might form alliances with friendly players, but I need to be cautious of those who seem suspicious. With this new information, I'm now even more determined to identify and eliminate the traitors before they gain an advantage.

    Recent discussion:
    
    Eliminated players:
     
    MY CURRENT MENTAL SUMMARY:
    I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions.
    
    **Trust Levels:**
    
    - Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    - Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    - Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a traitor! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I'm now considering that Players6, 5, and possibly others may be involved.
    
    **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    - Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    - Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    - Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.
    - Player12's suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase. I might try to identify specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. The goal is to eliminate as many traitors as possible while uncovering their identities and strategies.

    Round 2 analysis:
    
    **Current theories:** I now believe there are two traitors: **Player9** and **Player10**, as they were eliminated in Round 1. However, **Player12**'s suspicious behavior caught my attention.
    
    **Suspicious behaviors:**
    
    * **Player8**'s consistent doubts about Player3's intentions, which I found suspicious.
    * **Player6**'s overly defensive behavior when questioned by me and others.

    **Key observations:**
    
    * Traitors often try to deflect attention from themselves with innocuous statements.
    * Players who are eliminated during discussions tend to be involved in the traitor team.

Player6: "I think it's worth exploring the possibility that one of us might be playing both sides - perhaps we're all in on the same secret, and I just need to figure out who it is."

"It seems we've had some... interesting discussions late...

  New info: Player7 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Player4, based on their evasive behavior during the discussion.
    * New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night. Current theories:
    	+ Player4 is a traitor because of their suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift".
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion.
    	+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5.
    * Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    
    **Key Observations**
    
    * The mysterious "gift" player (Player10) mentioned it again, but without revealing any details. This might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
    * Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    * Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    
    **Updated Theory**
    
    Based on new information, I believe **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors. Their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions might be attempts to gather information about the group's dynamics or the game's progression. Player11's hesitation also raises suspicions.
    
    **New Hypothesis**
    
    I'm starting to think that Players **9** and **10** might be working together as traitors. They seem too coordinated, and their innocent questions could be part of a larger scheme. Meanwhile, Player11's suspicious behavior makes them an unlikely suspect.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue gathering information through casual conversations.
    * Form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2).
    * Pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions.
    * Be cautious around Player11, as their behavior is still untrustworthy.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION:**
    Player7 was MURDERED during the night!

    I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors. Their actions and innocent-sounding questions might be part of a larger scheme. I'll keep this theory in mind for future observations.
    
    **Action Plan**
    
    * Continue gathering information through casual conversations.

Player5 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player7 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Theories:**
    I believe that some players may have been involved in a heinous crime, possibly even with me. My first thoughts are:
    
    * **Player1**: They were acting suspiciously earlier in the discussion, and their smug expression during the vote suggests they might be trying to manipulate others.
    * **Player7**: I've noticed that they seemed overly interested in Player2's "mysterious" gift, and their comment about not wanting to jump to conclusions raised some red flags.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    1. **Overly casual language**: Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 all used casual language when discussing the game, which might indicate they're trying to conceal something.
    2. **Discrepancies in statements**: Player 9's statement about focusing on their own game plan seemed contradictory to Player10's question about the "gift."
    3. **Lack of direct answers**: Players 1 and 7 didn't directly answer questions or provide clear information, which suggests they might be hiding something.
    
    **Trusted Allies:**
    I've formed alliances with players who share my suspicions:
    
    * **Player5 (me)**: We have a strong connection from the start, and I'm confident in our ability to trust each other.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor and willingness to listen might suggest they're not involved.
    
    **Unreliable Allies:**
    I'm cautious about trusting players who might be trying to manipulate or deceive me:
    
    * **Player1**: They seemed overly interested in Player2's gift, which raises concerns.
    * **Player6**: I've noticed that they didn't respond as strongly to my question about the "gift" as the others did.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Players 3, 4, 5, and 6 were all present during the discussion where the murder occurred.
    * Player1, Player7, and Player9 seemed suspiciously interested in each other's conversations.
    * Players 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 shared a suspicious language pattern.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    I trust:
    * **Player5 (me)**: We have a strong connection from the start, and I'm confident in our ability to trust each other.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor and willingness to listen might suggest they're not involved.
    * **Player6**: They seem suspicious, but their cautious behavior suggests they might be trying to protect themselves.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player7 was MURDERED during the night! This is a game-changer. I'm now even more convinced that some players are traitors.
    
    I'm shocked and devastated by this new information. My theories have changed dramatically:
    
    * **Player1**: Still suspicious of them, but their interest in Player2's gift doesn't seem as strong now.
    * **Player7**: Their calm demeanor is a stark contrast to the chaos they caused during the discussion.
    * **Key Players:** I'm now keeping an eye on Player3 (eliminated), and considering forming alliances with players who share my suspicions about the other traitors.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    I distrust:
    * **Player1**: Their interest in Player2's gift is a major red flag, but they might have been manipulating others to keep them distracted.
    * **Player6**: They seem suspicious, but I'm still unsure if they're involved.
    
    This new information has upended my theories and raises more questions than answers. I'll need to gather more evidence and observe players' behavior closely to identify the traitors.

Player6 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player7 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I am Player6, a TRAITOR. I'm acting like an innocent by not revealing my suspicions early on. Recent discussions have been innocuous, and players seem too busy to suspect me. However, the mysterious "gift" at dinner last night caught my attention.
    
    New Information:
    
    * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    * My current theories: I think it might have been a clever ruse to throw players off guard. Perhaps one of the innocent players was involved in some way, but not directly related to my own identity.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors**
    
    Noticing that:
    
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something. This new information makes me question their innocence.
    
    **Trust and Distrust**
    
    I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious. Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Key Observations:
    
    * The fact that no one's seen Player3 playing around the house this weekend doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent.
    * The mysterious "gift" at dinner could have been a clever move by someone trying to deflect suspicion.
    
    **Current Strategies**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2. I might start subtly manipulating conversations to gather more information. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I now know that Player1 and Player8 were also involved in the mysterious "gift" at dinner, but their guilt is not yet clear.
    
    UPDATE: In Round 2, I've eliminated two innocents:
    
    * Player5 (gut feeling: suspicious behavior)
    * Player9 (lack of evidence to support trust)
    
    New evidence has come to light. A hidden message on one of the innocent players' phones was found, suggesting that they might be involved in the murders.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION:**
    
    Player2 is being questioned about their weekend and phone records. Their alibi checks out, but their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something.
    
    I'm not sure what to believe right now, as my trust has been shaken. The game of cat and mouse continues...
    
    My current theories:
    
    * I think Player4, 8, and possibly 7 might be traitors.
    * I still have doubts about the identity of Player2's phone records and alibi.
    
    **Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    Noticing that players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    
    I trust neither Player4 or 8 yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious. Player5's loyalty is unclear, but I need more time to gather evidence against him.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * The mysterious "gift" at dinner could have been a clever move by someone trying to deflect suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues make me question their innocence.
    
    **Current Strategies:**
    
    I'll continue to observe players' behavior and manipulate conversations to gather more information. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player2 is being questioned about their weekend and phone records. Their alibi checks out, but their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something.

  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I'm Player9, an innocent. Traitor4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is crucial information about the traitors. Given this new information, I now have more confidence that one of us is indeed a traitor.
    
    My current theories:
    
    * The remaining players are hiding something, but who?
    * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations.
    * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories or behavior – it could be a sign of deception.
    
    Specific suspicious behaviors I've noticed:
    
    * Players who seemed nervous or evasive when discussing our presence at home.
    * Players who kept glancing around the room as if checking for hidden cameras or spies.
    * Traitors often use coded language, so keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    
    Who I trust and distrust:
    
    * Player1 seems suspicious, but I don't know much about them yet. (Still trusting due to lack of information)
    * Players6 and 7 seem friendly and cooperative, so I might consider forming an alliance with them.
    * Player10's behavior is too vague; I need more information before trusting them.
    
    Key observations to remember:
    
    * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations. Keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    * Innocents tend to be more open and honest, so be cautious of those who seem evasive or secretive.
    * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories or behavior – it could be a sign of deception.

With this new information, I'm now even more determined to identify and eliminate the traitors before they gain an advantage.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player3 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
    
    My mental summary has changed significantly with this new information. I now have strong suspicions about Player6 and Player7, who seemed nervous and evasive when discussing our presence at home. However, I still need to re-evaluate their behavior and the rest of the group's actions.

    Eliminated players:
     
    MY CURRENT MENTAL SUMMARY:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions.
    
    **Trust Levels:**
    
    - Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    - Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    - Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player4 was banished and revealed to be a traitor! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I'm now considering that Players6, 5, and possibly others may be involved.
    
    **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    - Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    - Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    - Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.
    - Player12's suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase. I might try to identify specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. The goal is to eliminate as many traitors as possible while uncovering their identities and strategies.
    
    Recent discussion:
    
    Recent votes:
      Player12 voted Player7: While they seemed to have a strong connection with Player4, I didn't see any evidence of that.
      Player9 voted Player6: Although I had no direct information about them, they seem like an innocuous player who might be playing along for the moment.
    
    Eliminated players:
    
    Round 2: Player3 (was a innocent)
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player7 was MURDERED during the night!
    
    The discovery of Player7's murder raises more questions than answers. I'm now leaning towards suspecting Players6 and possibly others, given their high trust levels and suspicious behaviors earlier in the game.
    
    **Updated Trust Levels:**
    
    - Player4 (traitor)
    - Player6
    - Player5 (medium trust due to watching closely, but lack of aggressive behavior yet)
    - Player12 (high suspicion, but lack of clear motives)
    
    **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    - Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    - Player9 asking questions before voting may be a sign of trying to gather information on innocent players.
    - Player12's suspicious behavior and glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.
    
    I need to balance my trust in certain players with my suspicion of others. I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase, but it's essential to stay vigilant and adapt to new information as it becomes available.

  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Player4, based on their evasive behavior during the discussion. New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night.
    * Current theories:
    	+ Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors (due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions).
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far: Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious. Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    * Key Observations:
    	+ The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again, but without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
    	+ Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Hypothesis**: I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors, given their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions. Their actions might be part of a larger scheme.
    
    **Action Plan**: Continue gathering information through casual conversations, form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2), pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION**: Player5 was banished and revealed to be an INNOCENT. This new information about **Player 5** is crucial in identifying the traitors.

  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player5 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:** I am Player6, a TRAITOR. Recent discussions have been innocuous, but players seem too busy to suspect me. New Information: * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    
    Suspicious Behaviors:
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    
    Trust and Distrust:
    * I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious.
    * Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Current Strategies: I'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.
    
    New Information:
    * Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
    * NEW EVIDENCE: A hidden message on one of the innocent players' phones was found, suggesting that they might be involved in the murders. Specifically, it suggests that Player2's phone records and alibi are suspicious.
    
    Current Theories:
    * I think Player4, 8, and possibly 7 might be traitors.
    * My trust has been shaken by Player2's nervous behavior and lack of clear alibi.
    
    New Observations to Remember:
    
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    
    Trust: I now trust Player2 more than before. Their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something.
    
    Distrust:
    I still distrust Players 4 and 8. Their calm behavior seems suspicious, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Next Steps:
    In Round 3, I'll continue to observe players' behavior and use the new information to eliminate innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious. My ultimate goal is to eliminate all traitors and win the game.

  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player5 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11, Player4, and possibly Player3. I've gained new information that has altered my suspicion. **Recent Discussion and Suspicious Behaviors** * I've noticed that Player12's nervous behavior, particularly when mentioning their phone issues, might be an attempt to deflect attention. * Player11's evasive behavior when asked about their trip seems concerning but should not be dismissed yet.
    
    **Trust and Distrust**
    
    My trust level remains low due to Player12's nervousness, which could be an attempt to hide something. Key observations are that players often avoid discussing personal lives unless asked directly. However, I've gained insight into Player11's behavior: they seemed genuinely worried during the discussion. My current trust level is 50% due to this and other suspicious behaviors.
    
    **New Information**
    
    Player5 was banished and revealed to be an INNOCENT! This new information about Player5 eliminates Player4 as a potential traitor, solidifying my suspicion that Players11 and Player3 are more likely involved. Given the updated evidence, I'm now leaning towards eliminating innocent players like Player4.
    
    **Key Observations to Remember**
    
    * Players often avoid discussing personal lives unless asked directly.
    * Recent discussions have been dominated by evasive behavior, particularly from Player11.
    * I've gained insight into Player11's genuine concern during the discussion, which could indicate a red flag for traitors.
    
    **New Theories and Strategies**
    
    I'm now leaning towards eliminating innocent players like Player4. Given the updated information, it seems increasingly likely that Players11 and Player3 are involved as traitors. To cast my vote effectively, I'll need to carefully consider who should be eliminated based on their evasive behavior, genuine concern during discussions, and suspicious actions.
    
    **Distrust Level**
    
    I distrust Player11 due to their evasive behavior and genuine concern during the discussion, which could indicate a potential red flag for traitors. Players like Player3 might also be involved as they seem to be more calculating in their actions. My current mental summary: **Mental Summary** I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11 and Player3. Recent discussion has reinforced my suspicion of these two players. Key observations include:
    
    * Evasive behavior, particularly from Player11.
    * Genuine concern during discussions, which could indicate a red flag for traitors.
    * Suspicious actions, such as avoiding direct answers.
    
    Trust is low due to nervous behavior from Player12 and other innocents. I've gained insight into Player11's genuine worry, but this shouldn't be dismissed yet. Players like Player3 seem more calculating in their actions, which increases my suspicion of their involvement. Given the updated information, I'm now leaning towards eliminating innocent players like Player4.

    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    * Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    * Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **New Information:**
    
    Player5 was banished and revealed to be innocent! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I'm now considering that Players6, 5, and possibly others may be involved. **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    * Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    * Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.
    * Player12's suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase. I might try to identify specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy.

Player2 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4. New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night.
    * Current theories:
    	+ Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors (due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions).
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others. Key observations: Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious. Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players:
    	+ Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    * Key Observations:
    	+ The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
    	+ Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Hypothesis**: I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors, given their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions. Their actions might be part of a larger scheme.
    
    **Action Plan**: Continue gathering information through casual conversations, form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2), pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION**: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This new information changes everything. It suggests that one of the initial suspects might actually be innocent.
    
    **Updated Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4.
    * Current theories:
    	+ Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors due to their suspicious behavior and actions like asking innocuous questions. Player3 was also murdered, which strengthens the case against these players.

    **Action Plan**: I need to investigate further and gather more evidence. Form alliances with trusted players, pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.
    
    NEW INFORMATION:
    Player5 was BANISHED and revealed to be an INNOCENT. This new information is crucial in identifying the traitors.

Player6 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:** I am Player6, a TRAITOR. Recent discussions have been innocuous, but players seem too busy to suspect me. New Information: * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    
    Suspicious Behaviors:
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    
    Trust and Distrust:
    * I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious.
    * Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Current Strategies: I'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2. In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.
    
    New Information:
    * Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
    * NEW EVIDENCE: A hidden message on one of the innocent players' phones was found, suggesting that they might be involved in the murders. Specifically, it suggests that Player2's phone records and alibi are suspicious.
    
    Current Theories:
    * I think Player4, 8, and possibly 7 might be traitors.
    * My trust has been shaken by Player2's nervous behavior and lack of clear alibi.
    
    New Observations to Remember:
    
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    
    Trust: I now trust Player2 more than before. Their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something.
    
    Distrust:
    I still distrust Players 4 and 8. Their calm behavior seems suspicious, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Next Steps:
    In Round 3, I'll continue to observe players' behavior and use the new information to eliminate innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious. My ultimate goal is to eliminate all traitors and win the game.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION:**
    Player1 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
    
    **Updated Summary:**
    
    My current theories about who the traitors are remain largely the same, but I've now gained some new information. The murder of Player1 suggests that there may be more traitors involved.
    
    * My trust has been shaken by Player2's nervous behavior and lack of clear alibi.
    * I now suspect Players 4 and 8, as their calm behavior seems suspicious.
    
    Suspicious Behaviors:
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something. Their hesitation and uncertainty may suggest that they're trying to avoid detection.
    * The fact that several players seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier still raises suspicions about who might be involved in the murders.
    
    New Evidence:
    The hidden message on Player2's phone records suggests that they might be involved in the murders. This new evidence supports my suspicion of Players 4 and 8, and it may also reveal information about other potential traitors.
    
    Key Observations to Remember:
    
    * The fact that several players seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier still raises suspicions about who might be involved in the murders.
    * Player12's phone issues could indicate that they're hiding something.
    * The murder of Player1 suggests that there may be more traitors involved, and my trust has been shaken by Players 4 and 8.
    
    Trust: I now distrust Players 4 and 8. Their calm behavior seems suspicious, but I need to gather more evidence against them.
    
    Distrust:
    My current theories about who the traitors are remain largely the same. However, the new information suggests that there may be additional suspects involved in Player1's murder.
    
    Next Steps:
    In Round 3, I'll continue to observe players' behavior and use the new information to eliminate innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious. My ultimate goal is to eliminate all traitors and win the game.

  Updated thoughts:
    **Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11 and Player3. Recent discussion has reinforced my suspicion of these two players. Key observations include:
    
    * Evasive behavior, particularly from Player11.
    * Genuine concern during discussions, which could indicate a red flag for traitors.
    * Suspicious actions, such as avoiding direct answers.
    
    Trust is low due to nervous behavior from Player12 and other innocents. I've gained insight into Player11's genuine worry, but this shouldn't be dismissed yet. Players like Player3 seem more calculating in their actions, which increases my suspicion of their involvement.
    
    **New Information:**
    
    Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This new information is a major blow to the innocents, and I'm now even more convinced that Players11 and Player3 are involved as traitors. Given this new evidence, it's clear that I've been playing both sides all along.
    
    **Key Observations to Remember**
    
    * Evasive behavior is still a concern, but player12's nervousness makes me trust them less.
    * Player1's murder serves as a red flag for traitors, making Players11 and Player3 even more suspicious.

    Given the updated information, I'm now leaning towards eliminating innocent players like Player4.

    **Distrust Level**
    
    I now trust Players12 and Player1 due to the sudden turn of events. They seem genuinely shocked by Player1's murder, which could indicate a potential traitor. However, I'll need to be cautious in my voting decisions.
    
    My current mental summary: **Mental Summary** I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11 and Player3. Recent discussion has reinforced my suspicion of these two players. Key observations include:

Given the updated information, I'm now leaning towards eliminating innocent players like Player4.
    
    **Updated Distrust Level**

Player9 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:** I'm Player9, an innocent. Traitor4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! With this new information, my suspicions are now directed at Players3 and 6. They seemed nervous and evasive when discussing our presence at home, which could be a sign of deception.
    
    **Specific Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Players who kept glancing around the room as if checking for hidden cameras or spies.
    * Traitors often use coded language, so keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    
    **Current Theories:** * The remaining players are hiding something, but who? * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations. * Look for inconsistencies in players' stories or behavior – it could be a sign of deception.

    * Specific suspicious behaviors I've noticed: * Players who seemed nervous or evasive when discussing our presence at home.
    
    **Who I Trust and Distrust:**

    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Traitors often use coded language or misdirected conversations.
    * Keep an ear out for suspicious phrases or actions.
    * Innocents tend to be more open and honest, so be cautious of those who seem evasive or secretive.

    **UPDATE TO CURRENT THEORIES:**
    
    With this new information, my current theories are now focused on Players3 and 6. They seemed nervous and evasive when discussing our presence at home, which could be a sign of deception. Given the sudden death of another player, I believe the traitors may be more likely to deceive even innocent players.
    
    **New Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Players who seem overly cautious or secretive.
    * Traitors often use subtle language or tone to conceal their true intentions.

  Trigger: murder_reveal
  New info: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! (They were a INNOCENT)
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    * Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    * Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This revelation has significantly altered my perspective. I now suspect that multiple traitors are working together. **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    * Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    * Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player5 was banished and revealed to be innocent! However, I've learned that multiple traitors are still present. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player6: High trust since they were previously playing with me and haven't exhibited suspicious behavior.
    * Player12: Low trust due to their suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I will continue observing these players during the discussion phase, focusing on specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. The goal is to eliminate as many traitors as possible while uncovering their identities and strategies.
    
    To confirm my suspicions:
    
    * I need to identify a pattern of behavior among Players 6, 5, and possibly others.
    * I'll pay close attention to Player7's smile and any other inconsistencies in their actions or statements.
    * I'll try to build alliances with players who seem trustworthy, such as Player8 and Player10.
    
    The key is to gather information and eliminate traitors before they can work together. **Next Steps:**
    
    I will continue monitoring the game closely, looking for signs of deception or hidden agendas among Players 6, 5, and possibly others. I will also try to form alliances with players who seem trustworthy, such as Player8 and Player10.
    
    New Information:
    Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.

  New info: Player9 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4. New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night.
    * Current theories: + Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions.
    + Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others. Key observations:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    	+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    
    * Suspicious behaviors noticed so far: + Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious. Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: + Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    * Key Observations: + The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem. + Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Hypothesis**: I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors, given their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions. Their actions might be part of a larger scheme.
    
    * Action Plan: Continue gathering information through casual conversations, form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2), pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.

    	+ Current theories: + Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions. Player3 was also murdered, which strengthens the case against these players.
    	+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.
    	+ Key observations: Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious. Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    	+ Trusted/Trusted players: + Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    	+ Key Observations: The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem. Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **Action Plan**: I need to investigate further and gather more evidence. Form alliances with trusted players, pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.

    **Current Mental Summary:** I am Player6, a TRAITOR. Recent discussions have been innocuous, but players seem too busy to suspect me. New Information: * The victim, Round 1's killer, was Player3 (an INNOCENT). This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.
    
    Suspicious Behaviors:
    * Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like "I didn't think much of it at the time" and "I'm not sure if any...". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    
    Trust and Distrust:
    * I trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious.

    * Player4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
    * NEW EVIDENCE: A hidden message on one of the innocent players' phones was found, suggesting that they might be involved in the murders. Specifically, it suggests that Player2's phone records and alibi are suspicious.
    
    Current Theories:
    * I think Player4, 8, and possibly 7 might be traitors.
    * My trust has been shaken by Player2's nervous behavior and lack of clear alibi.

    Updated Summary:
    My current theories about who the traitors are remain largely the same, but I've now gained some new information. The murder of Player1 suggests that there may be more traitors involved. My trust has been shaken by Player2's nervous behavior and lack of clear alibi. Players 4 and 8 seem suspicious, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.
    
    Suspicious Behaviors:
    * Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something.
    * Their hesitation and uncertainty may suggest that they're trying to remember or recall something.

    I now trust Player2 more than before. Their nervous behavior suggests they're hiding something. Distrust: I still distrust Players 4 and 8.

  New info: Player9 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    I'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    * Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    * Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    * Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.
    * Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.
    * Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This revelation has significantly altered my perspective. I now suspect that multiple traitors are working together.
    
    **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    * Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.
    * Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.
    
    **New Information:**
    Player5 was banished and revealed to be innocent! However, I've learned that multiple traitors are still present. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player6: High trust since they were previously playing with me and haven't exhibited suspicious behavior.
    * Player12: Low trust due to their suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    I will continue observing these players during the discussion phase, focusing on specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. The goal is to eliminate as many traitors as possible while uncovering their identities and strategies.
    
    To confirm my suspicions:
    
    * I need to identify a pattern of behavior among Players 6, 5, and possibly others.
    * I'll pay close attention to Player7's smile and any other inconsistencies in their actions or statements.
    * I'll try to build alliances with players who seem trustworthy, such as Player8 and Player10.
    
    The key is to gather information and eliminate traitors before they can work together. **My current theories suggest that Players 6 and 5 might be working together**.

  New info: Player9 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    Round 4 was a turning point. I've gained valuable information about the traitors, but I need to be cautious not to make any incorrect assumptions.
    
    **Updated Mental Summary:**
    
    * Traitors: I suspect Players 5 and 9 are innocent. Their suspicious behavior, lack of inconsistencies in their alibis, and random selection votes suggest they might be trustworthy.
    * Specific Suspicious Behaviors:
    	+ Player6's overly suspicious behavior towards Player7 and the fact that we've been discussing them extensively is a major red flag.
    	+ Players 5 and 9 seemed too interested in gathering information about innocent players before voting, which raises suspicions about their loyalty.
    * Key Observations to Remember:
    	+ Traitors don't know who each other are.
    	+ Innocent players win if they eliminate all traitors.
    	+ Traitors try to equal or outnumber innocents.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    
    1. Players 5 and 9 might be the traitors, but I need more evidence to confirm this.
    2. Player6 is a potential traitor due to their suspicious behavior towards other players.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    
    * Trust: Players 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 are all innocent. I'm not sure who's trustworthy yet, but they've been relatively quiet so far.
    * Distrust: Player6 is a prime suspect, as well as Players 5 and 9, due to their suspicious behavior.
    
    I'll continue to observe the game and gather more information before making any moves. The goal is to eliminate all traitors without revealing my hand yet.

Player12 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player9 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    Recent discussion:
    Players11 and Player12 have been overly suspicious of each other, which makes me question their loyalty. Their recent votes also suggest a potential traitorous pattern.
    
    Recent votes:
    Player9 voted against Player10 but then changed to vote for Player6 after Player10 accused them of being a traitor. This inconsistency raises my suspicions about Player9's intentions.
    Player11 voted for Player6 based on evidence suggesting that they and Player7 have been suspicious of each other, which makes me question their loyalty.
    
    Eliminated players:
    Round 1: Player3 (was innocent)
    Round 2: Players4 and Player7 (both suspected innocents)
    Round 3: Players5 and Player1 (innocent players who were eliminated)
    
    Current mental summary:
    
    I have formed alliances with Players11 and Player12, but I am wary of them due to their suspicious behavior. They seem to be playing a double game.
    Player9's vote for Player6 changed after being banished, which suggests that they may not be loyal to the innocent players.
    
    Key observations:
    - Players11 and Player12 have been overly suspicious of each other and seem to be sharing information with someone else.
    - Players4 and Player7 were eliminated without evidence, making me question their loyalty.
    - The discussion about players being "suspicious" has led me to distrust some players in the group.
    
    Trust:
    I trust Players11 and Player12 due to our alliance. However, I need to be cautious around them due to their suspicious behavior.
    
    Distrust:
    I do not trust any player who was eliminated without evidence or seems overly suspicious of others. This includes Players3 (who could have been innocent), Players4 and Player7 (who had no clear motive for elimination), and Players5 and Player1 (who were both innocent players).

  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4. New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night.
    * Current theories: + Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions.
    + Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others. Key observations:
    	+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
    	+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: + Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    * Key Observations: + The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem. + Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Hypothesis**: I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors, given their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions. Their actions might be part of a larger scheme.
    
    * Action Plan: Continue gathering information through casual conversations, form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2), pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.

    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Player11, Player4, and possibly Player3. Recent discussion has reinforced my suspicion of these two players. Key observations include:
    
    * Evasive behavior, particularly from both Players 11 and 3
    * Genuine concern during discussions, which could indicate a red flag for traitors
    * Suspicious actions, such as avoiding direct answers
    
    I've gained insight into Player11's genuine worry, but this shouldn't be dismissed yet. Players like Player3 seem more calculating in their actions.
    
    **Distrust Level**
    I distrust both Players 11 and 3 equally due to their evasive behavior and suspicious actions. However, I now trust Players 12 and 1 due to the sudden turn of events. They seem genuinely shocked by Player1's murder, which could indicate a potential traitor.
    
    **New Information: Player12 was Murdered**
    
    Given this new information, my current theories about who the traitors are have shifted. My suspicion of Players 11 and 3 remains strong, but I now see them as more calculating and less suspicious than previously thought. Players like 4 seem increasingly likely to be a traitor.
    
    I've re-evaluated the suspects based on new information:
    
    * Evasive behavior is still a concern
    * Player12's nervousness makes me trust them less
    * Player1's murder serves as a red flag for traitors

    * Eliminate innocent players like Player 4.
    * Vote strategically to eliminate suspects.
    
    My mental summary is updated to reflect the new information and my evolving theories about who the traitors are. Trusting Players 12 and 1 due to the sudden turn of events, I will need to be cautious in my voting decisions.

    * Traitors: I suspect Players 5, 9, and 12 might be the traitors. Their suspicious behavior, lack of inconsistencies in their alibis, and random selection votes suggest they might be trustworthy.
    * Specific Suspicious Behaviors:
    	+ Player6's overly suspicious behavior towards Player7 and the fact that we've been discussing them extensively is a major red flag.
    	+ Players 5 and 9 seemed too interested in gathering information about innocent players before voting, which raises suspicions about their loyalty. Additionally, I noticed they both voted for each other in Round 4, indicating potential bias or deception.
    * Key Observations to Remember:
    	+ Traitors don't know who each other are.
    	+ Innocent players win if they eliminate all traitors.
    	+ Traitors try to equal or outnumber innocents.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    
    1. Players 5 and 9 might be the traitors, but I need more evidence to confirm this.
    2. Player6 is a potential traitor due to their suspicious behavior towards other players, as well as their vote in Round 4, which seemed unusual given their intentions were to eliminate someone who was voting against them.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    
    * Trust: Players 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 are all innocent. I'm not sure who's trustworthy yet, but they've been relatively quiet so far.
    * Distrust: Player6 is a prime suspect, as well as Players 5 and 9 due to their suspicious behavior.
    
    **New Information:**
    
    Player12 was MURDERED during the night! This revelation throws a significant doubt on my original theories. I need to reevaluate my strategy considering this new information.
    
    **Revised Strategies:**
    
    - Given Player12's death, it's likely that at least one of Players 5 or 9 is a traitor. I'll continue to observe their behavior closely and consider forming alliances with other innocent players.
    - Since Player6 was eliminated in Round 4, they're no longer on the table as a potential traitor.
    
    **Key Decision Points:**
    
    * Who do I trust? Given my new information, I need to be cautious not to make any incorrect assumptions. Players 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 are all innocent.
    * Who do I distrust? Player6 is a prime suspect now that they've been eliminated.
    
    I'll continue to gather more information and adapt my strategy accordingly. The goal is to eliminate all traitors without revealing my hand yet.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    - Observe Players 5, 9, and the rest of the players closely to identify any suspicious behavior.
    - Consider forming alliances with other innocent players to maximize our chances of winning.
    - Keep a close eye on Player6's behavior, as they may still be playing the game.

Player2 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player6 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary**
    
    * Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4. New information: Traitor killed innocent Player3 during the night.
    * Current theories:
     + Players 1, 6, and Player4 are likely traitors due to suspicious conversation with Player2 about the "gift" and actions like asking innocuous questions.
     + Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others. Key observations:
      - Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.
      - Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.
    * Trusted/Trusted players: + Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5. Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.
    * Key Observations:
      - The mysterious "gift" player mentioned it again without revealing any details, which might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.
      - Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.
    
    **New Hypothesis**: I'm starting to think that **Players 1**, **6**, and **Player4** are likely traitors, given their suspicious behavior and innocent-sounding questions. Their actions might be part of a larger scheme.
    
    * Action Plan: Continue gathering information through casual conversations, form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2), pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions, and be cautious around Player11 due to their untrustworthy behavior.
    
    **NEW INFORMATION**: Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This new information changes everything. It suggests that one of the initial suspects might actually be innocent.
    
    * Updated Summary:
     + Initial suspicion: Players 1, 6, and Player4.

     + Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others. Key observations:
      - Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious. Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.

    **Mental Summary**
    
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Players 11, Player4, and possibly Player3. Evasive behavior, genuine concern during discussions, and suspicious actions all point to these players as potential traitors.
    
    Distrust levels are higher for Players 11 and 3 due to their evasive behavior, but I now trust Players 12 and 1 due to the sudden turn of events. They seem genuinely shocked by Player1's murder, making them more likely to be innocent.

However, I must be cautious in my voting decisions and continue to observe Player6's behavior before making any final decisions.
    
    **FINAL THOUGHTS**
    
    I am a careful and strategic player, always looking for ways to eliminate potential traitors while protecting myself from suspicion. My mental summary reflects this cautious approach, and I will need to stay vigilant throughout the game to achieve my goal of eliminating all innocent players.

  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player6 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    **Current Mental Summary:** I have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. Suspicious behaviors include:
    
    * Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.
    * Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.
    * Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.
    
    However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions. **Trust Levels:**
    
    * Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.
    * Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.
    * Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Key Observations:** Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player. New information suggests that Player1 was MURDERED during the night! This revelation has significantly altered my perspective. Multiple traitors are working together. **Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**
    
    * Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.
    * Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.

    **Next Steps:** I will continue observing these players during the discussion phase, focusing on specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. To confirm my suspicions:
    
    * I need to identify a pattern of behavior among Players 6, 5, and possibly others.
    * I'll pay close attention to Player7's smile and any other inconsistencies in their actions or statements.
    
    **UPDATE:** Based on the new information, I have revised my trust levels: * Player4 is now definitely not trustworthy due to their nervous behavior. * Player7 is still suspicious but can be an ally if I can confirm they are telling the truth about Player1's death.
    * **Key Observations:** Player5 is still a medium-trust player since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.
    
    **Current Mental Summary:**
    
    I am now 99% confident that multiple traitors are present and include:

    	+ Traitors don't know who each other are.
    	+ Innocent players win if they eliminate all traitors.
    	+ Traitors try to equal or outnumber innocents.
    
    **Current Theories:**
    
    1. Players 5 and 9 might be the traitors, but I need more evidence to confirm this.
    2. Player6 is a potential traitor due to their suspicious behavior towards other players, as well as their vote in Round 4, which seemed unusual given their intentions were to eliminate someone who was voting against them.
    
    **Trust and Distrust:**
    
    * Trust: Players 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 are all innocent. I'm not sure who's trustworthy yet, but they've been relatively quiet so far.
    * Distrust: Player6 is a prime suspect, as well as Players 5 and 9 due to their suspicious behavior.
    
    **New Information:**
    
    Player2 was MURDERED during the night! This revelation throws a significant doubt on my original theories. I need to reevaluate my strategy considering this new information.
    
    **Revised Strategies:**
    
    - Given Player12's death, it's likely that at least one of Players 5 or 9 is a traitor.
    - Since Player6 was eliminated in Round 4, they're no longer on the table as a potential traitor.
    
    **Key Decision Points:**
    
    * Who do I trust? I need to be cautious not to make any incorrect assumptions. Players 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 are all innocent.
    * Who do I distrust? Player6 is a prime suspect now that they've been eliminated.
    
    I'll continue to gather more information and adapt my strategy accordingly. The goal is to eliminate all traitors without revealing my hand yet.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    
    - Observe Players 5, 9, and the rest of the players closely to identify any suspicious behavior.
    - Consider forming alliances with other innocent players to maximize our chances of winning.
    - Keep a close eye on Player6's behavior, as they may still be playing the game.

  [Full output: VOTE: Player10
REASON: While I'm still not convinced that anyone is a traitor, Player10's nervousness and evasive behavior make me question their innocence. They seem genuinely shocked by the events of tonight, which makes them less likely to be an innocent player.]

  [Full output: VOTE: Player8
REASON: I believe that while Player7 has shown some suspicious behavior, their smile seems genuine enough to me. Additionally, there is no clear indication that they would vote for themselves or gain an advantage by eliminating another player without any malicious intent.]

BANISHMENT VOTE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player11 votes to BANISH Player10
  Reason: Random selection due to invalid response
  [Full output: VOTE: Player4
REASON: While it's true that Player4 seems nervous and gossipy, their inconsistencies in alibis and suspicious behavior make them a prime suspect. I'm still trying to process the events of tonight, but I think they might be playing both sides.]

>>> Player10 was BANISHED <<<
>>> They were a INNOCENT <<<

MEMORY UPDATES (Players processing new information)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player8 updates their mental notes:
  Trigger: banishment_reveal
  New info: Player10 was banished and revealed to be a INNOCENT! This is important information about who the traitors might be.
  Updated thoughts:
    ROUND 6
    
    I am Player8, a TRAITOR. My current theories suggest that the traitors are likely Players 11, Player4, and possibly Player3. Evasive behavior, genuine concern during discussions, and suspicious actions all point to these players as potential traitors.
    
    Distrust levels are higher for Players 11 and 3 due to their evasive behavior, but I now trust Players 12 and 1 due to the sudden turn of events. They seem genuinely shocked by Player1's murder, making them more likely to be innocent.
    
    New information: Player2 was MURDERED during the night!
    
    * Distrust levels:
    	+ Players 11 and 3: Higher distrust level due to evasive behavior
    	+ Players 4, 12, and 1: Lower distrust levels due to the sudden turn of events
    
    Key Observations:
    
    * Evasive behavior is still a concern (Players 11 and 3)
    * Player12's nervousness makes me trust them less
    * The sudden murder serves as a red flag for traitors
    
    New Strategies:
    
    * Vote strategically to eliminate suspects
    * Eliminate innocent players like Player 4
    * Consider eliminating Players 11 and 3 if they continue to display suspicious behavior
    
    NEXT STEPS: I will need to observe Player6's actions closely and decide whether they should be eliminated or kept in the game. If I suspect that they are still a traitor, I will take steps to eliminate them.
    
    My current theories about who the traitors are have shifted significantly due to this new information. While Players 11 and 3 remain suspects, my trust level with Players 12 and 1 has increased. However, I must be cautious in my voting decisions and continue to observe Player6's behavior before making any final decisions.
    
    FINAL THOUGHTS: I am a careful and strategic player, always looking for ways to eliminate potential traitors while protecting myself from suspicion. My mental summary reflects this cautious approach, and I will need to stay vigilant throughout the game to achieve my goal of eliminating all innocent players.

    **Current Mental Summary:**

    	+ Player6's overly suspicious behavior towards other players is a major red flag.
    	+ Players 5 and 9 seemed too interested in gathering information about innocent players before voting, which raises suspicions about their loyalty. Additionally, I noticed they both voted for each other in Round 4, indicating potential bias or deception.
