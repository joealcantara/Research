      "raw_output": "**Current Mental Summary**\n\n* New information: Player3 was murdered, which means the murderer is now a TRAITOR.\n* Suspicious behaviors:\n\t+ Player8 was smiling innocently while discussing \"drama\" earlier. It felt suspicious to me that they seemed overly enthusiastic about getting started with games without addressing potential drama.\n\t+ Players 9 and 10 were focused on their own plans, which didn't seem like a good sign. They also asked curious questions about other players' activities, which raised my suspicions.\n* Trust issues:\n\t+ I don't trust Player2 or Player11 very much right now. Their behavior seemed suspicious, especially with Player2 asking if anyone had seen them playing around the house during their trip to Europe.\n\t+ Player9's cautious approach didn't seem like a good strategy for us as an innocent group.\n* Distrust:\n\t+ I'm not sure who Player3 was telling me about my phone issues or what that might mean. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but it feels suspicious.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n* Players 6-11 were all sitting in one room during dinner and didn't seem to interact much with each other.\n* Players 8-10 seemed to be discussing their plans for the weekend without mentioning any potential conflicts or drama.\n* Player7 was acting nervous and fidgety throughout our discussion, which made me wonder if they might be hiding something.\n\n**Theory Update**\n\nBased on my observations and new information, I believe that at least 3-4 players are traitors. My top suspects so far include:\n\n1. Player2\n2. Player11 (due to their curious behavior and questions about other players' activities)\n3. Player8 (their suspicious smile during our discussion and possible connections to previous conversations)\n\nHowever, I need more evidence to confirm these suspicions. I'll keep a close eye on the situation and gather as much information as possible before making any accusations.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\n* Continue observing the behavior of other players\n* Keep asking questions to clarify their activities and intentions\n* Focus on building alliances with trustworthy players\n\nIt's time to take a closer look at the remaining players and see who I can trust."

Current theories:\n\t+ Player4 is a traitor because of their suspicious conversation with Player2 about the \"gift\".\n\t+ Other players might be innocent, but some traits seem more likely than others.\n* Suspicious behaviors noticed so far:\n\t+ Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion.\n\t+ Player11 seemed hesitant to disclose information, raising suspicions.\n* Trusted/Trusted players: Player2, Player3 (murdered), Player5.\n* Least trusted players: Players 1, 4, 6.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n* The mysterious \"gift\" player (Player10) mentioned it again, but without revealing any details. This might indicate they're not as involved in the game as they seem.\n* Player11's evasiveness and hesitation to discuss their trip to Europe could be a sign of deception.\n* Players 9 and 10 asked innocuous questions during the discussion, which is suspicious.\n\n**Updated Theory**\n\nBased on new information, I believe Players 9 and 10 are likely traitors. Their innocent-sounding questions might be attempts to gather information about the group's dynamics or the game's progression. Player11's hesitation also raises suspicions. On the other hand, Player4 seems like a more likely candidate - they seemed overly interested in discussing the \"gift\" with Player2.\n\n**New Hypothesis**\n\nI'm starting to think that Players 9 and 10 might be working together as traitors. They seem too coordinated, and their innocent questions could be part of a larger scheme. Meanwhile, Player11's suspicious behavior makes them an unlikely suspect. I'll keep this theory in mind for future observations.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\n* Continue gathering information through casual conversations.\n* Form alliances with players who seem trustworthy (Player2, Player3).\n* Pay close attention to Players 9 and 10's actions and questions.\n* Be cautious around Player11, as their behavior is still untrustworthy."

They've been quiet since then, which could indicate deceit.\n* Players9 and 10 have shown a lack of urgency in discussing game plans or gathering information, making me wonder if they're hiding something.\n\nTrust and distrust:\n\n* I don't trust Player8's innocence, given their previous response and lack of involvement in discussions about games.\n* However, I'm not entirely sure who to trust.

Perhaps they're trying to deflect attention or hide something.\n\n**NEW INFORMATION**\n\nPlayer3 has been murdered during the night, and I'm now a Traitor.

Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious. Players 5 and 9 might be loyal, but I need more time to gather evidence against them.\n\nKey Observations:\n\n* The fact that no one's seen Player3 playing around the house this weekend doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent.\n* The mysterious \"gift\" at dinner could have been a clever move by someone trying to deflect suspicion.\n* Players 10 and 11 might be hiding something, but I need more context before making accusations.\n\n**Current Strategies**\n\nI'll continue to observe players' behavior, especially in the days leading up to Round 2.

I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:\n\n* Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.\n* Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.\n* Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.\n\nI'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions.\n\n**Trust Levels:**\n\n- Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.\n- Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.\n- Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n* Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.\n* Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.\n* Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase to identify any further suspicious behavior. I might also try to gather more information from them or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy."

However, I need to keep an eye on them for any suspicious behavior.\n\n**Suspicious Behaviors:**\n\n* Players like Player4, who was quiet during the discussion about Player3's elimination.\n* The sudden lack of information from some players, such as Player1 or Player10.\n\nI should be cautious not to reveal too much about myself yet. I'll continue gathering information and keeping a close eye on my surroundings to identify potential traitors.\n\n**Current Theories:**\nBased on the new information, I'm considering the following possibilities:\n\n* Player3's past may hold some key clues about who the traitors are.\n* Traitors might be trying to cover their tracks by not revealing their identities during discussions.\n\nIt's essential to gather more information before making any accusations. For now, I'll remain vigilant and wait for further developments in the game."

Recent discussions have been innocuous, and players seem too busy to suspect me.

This new information has raised questions about who could be behind the murder.\n* My current theories: I think it might have been a clever ruse to throw players off guard. Perhaps one of the innocent players was involved in some way, but not directly related to my own identity.\n\n**Suspicious Behaviors**\n\nNoticing that:\n\n* Players 10 and 11 seemed hesitant when discussing their weekend plans earlier. They asked questions like \"I didn't think much of it at the time\" and \"I'm not sure if any...\". These comments made me curious, as I wonder if they might be trying to avoid suspicion.\n* Player12's phone issues could also indicate that they're hiding something. This new information makes me question their innocence.\n\n**Trust and Distrust**\n\nI trust neither of the innocent players (Players 4 and 8) yet. Their behavior seems too calm, making them seem suspicious.

In Round 2, I'll focus on eliminating innocents who seem too convenient or suspicious.\n\nNEW INFORMATION:\nPlayer4 was banished and revealed to be a TRAITOR!

      "raw_output": "Recent discussion:\n\nEliminated players:\n \nMY CURRENT MENTAL SUMMARY:\n**Current Mental Summary:**\n\nI have lost one innocent player, Player3. My current theories suggest that the eliminated player might be a traitor. I've also noticed some suspicious behaviors from other players, including:\n\n* Player4 seems nervous and fidgety during the game.\n* Player6 has been whispering with Player2 in hushed tones.\n* Player5 keeps looking at Player1 with an intense gaze.\n\nI'm starting to suspect that these players might be working together. However, I need more information to confirm my suspicions.\n\n**Trust Levels:**\n\n- Player4: Low trust due to their nervous behavior and tendency to gossip.\n- Player6: High trust as they've been playing nice with me and have no apparent motives.\n- Player5: Medium trust since they seem to be watching everyone closely, but I haven't seen any overt aggressive behavior yet.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n* Player7 has a large smile on their face throughout the game, which seems unusual for an innocent player.\n* Player9 keeps asking questions and appearing to gather information before voting.\n* Player12 is consistently acting suspiciously, glancing at other players with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.\n\n**New Information:**\nPlayer4 was banished and revealed to be a traitor! This is important information about who the traitors might be. I'm now considering that Players6, 5, and possibly others may be involved.\n\n**Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**\n\n- Player4's nervous behavior suggests they might not be trustworthy.\n- Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.\n- Player9 asking questions before voting is concerning as it may indicate they're trying to gather information on innocent players.\n- Player12's suspicious behavior and constant glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase. I might try to identify specific behaviors that could confirm my suspicions or form alliances with players who seem trustworthy. The goal is to eliminate as many traitors as possible while uncovering their identities and strategies.\n\nRecent discussion:\n\nRecent votes:\n  Player12 voted Player7: While they seemed to have a strong connection with Player4, I didn't see any evidence of that.\n  Player9 voted Player6: Although I had no direct information about them, they seem like an innocuous player who might be playing along for the moment.\n\nEliminated players:\n\nRound 2: Player3 (was a innocent)\n\nNEW INFORMATION:\nPlayer7 was MURDERED during the night!\n\nThe discovery of Player7's murder raises more questions than answers. I'm now leaning towards suspecting Players6 and possibly others, given their high trust levels and suspicious behaviors earlier in the game.\n\n**Updated Trust Levels:**\n\n- Player4 (traitor)\n- Player6\n- Player5 (medium trust due to watching closely, but lack of aggressive behavior yet)\n- Player12 (high suspicion, but lack of clear motives)\n\n**Trust and Suspicious Behaviors:**\n\n- Player7's smile could indicate they're hiding something or have an ulterior motive.\n- Player9 asking questions before voting may be a sign of trying to gather information on innocent players.\n- Player12's suspicious behavior and glancing around the room suggest they might be trying to cover up their tracks.\n\nI need to balance my trust in certain players with my suspicion of others. I'll continue observing these players during the discussion phase, but it's essential to stay vigilant and adapt to new information as it becomes available."
